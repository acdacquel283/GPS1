* What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    - I was struggling getting used to the Git workflow. I kept making changes in the master branch without working in a feature branch first before merging.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - The concept of pull requests was clarified during the GPS. I was not sure how that worked since I kept merging my files locally but now I know that in a real work setting, the pull request is the norm when merging work that was done in a different branch.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - I didn't have the chance to ask too many questions to my partner as I was unable to be the driver due to poor internet connectivity. I was able to ask the GPS on how the driver/navigator workflow looks and was able to get a better picture on how to work as a pair. I was able to ask questions regarding whether you can make changes to a file after staging but not committing. 
* What still confuses you about Git?
    - Merge conflict still confuses me. I'm not sure how to resolve it using the instructions given in the assignment. 
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - I had a great time with the first GPS. It was nervous at first but I think my pair and I worked really well and the GPS was very helpful with guiding us through the assignment. It definitely gave me a perspective on how it is to work with someone else on coding projects.
