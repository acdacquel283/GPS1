#My GPS 1 Reflection

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? I was struglling with just about everything overall, I know what each individual command does, but I'd like a better grasp of how it all works together as well as the correct time to use each command. I'm especially confused about the merge, push , and pull aspects.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS? A lot was clarified by simply practicing with others and a guide. I think for me practicing navigating different directories would help.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? We asked about having to commit afte each add. We discussed the use of branches and we talked some about git pull and push. We didn't have more time for the merge conflict.

What still confuses you about Git? Merge conflict and the process of understanding each output, especially when there are errors and I'm not familiar with how to read and comprehend those errors. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? It was a good experience. We both did a good job researching what we didn't know as well as pausing to be mindful and considerate of the other person.
